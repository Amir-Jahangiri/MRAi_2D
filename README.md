# MRAi_2D: Magnetic Resonance processing with Artificial intelligence for 2D spectra

## About
MRAi is an AI-powered tool for processing Magnetic Resonance data, specifically designed for 2D NMR spectra. With it, you can perform the following tasks:
* Non-Uniform Sampling (NUS) Reconstruction (`NUS_Rec.ipynb` [Preview](https://github.com/Amir-Jahangiri/MRAi_2D/blob/master/NUS_Rec.ipynb))
* Virtual homo-decoupling in a 2D methyl H-C—HMQC with J-coupling around 35 Hz (`VD_ID.ipynb` [Preview](https://github.com/Amir-Jahangiri/MRAi_2D/blob/master/VD_ID.ipynb))
* Echo or Anti-Echo Reconstruction with MRAi and Compressed Sensing (CS) (`Echo_Rec.ipynb` [Preview](https://github.com/Amir-Jahangiri/MRAi_2D/blob/master/Echo_Rec.ipynb))
* Uncertainty Estimation for Echo or Anti-Echo Reconstruction with MRAi and CS (`Uncertainty.ipynb` [Preview](https://github.com/Amir-Jahangiri/MRAi_2D/blob/master/Uncertainty.ipynb))
* Data generation and WNN architectures for training (`Generator.ipynb` [Preview](https://github.com/Amir-Jahangiri/MRAi_2D/blob/master/Generator.ipynb))"

## Installation
1. Install [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/) by following the Quick Command Line Install instructions.
2. Download MRAi_2D pacckege from [`Code`](https://github.com/Amir-Jahangiri/MRAi_2D/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
3. Unzip the `MRAi_2D-master.zip` file.
4. Open Terminal in `MRAi_2D-master/Packages` folder.
5. Create a conda environment with: 
```python
conda create -n mrai python=3.11
```
* Type `yes` if prompted.
* This may take a few minutes.
  
6. Active `mrai` environment with:
```python
conda activate mrai
```
7. Install `MRAi_2D` and `Proc_2D` with:
```python
pip install MRAi_2D-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```
```python
pip install Proc_2D-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```
* Installation may take a few minutes.
  
8. Install Jupyter with:
```python
conda install jupyter
```
* Type `yes` if prompted.
* This may take a few minutes.
  
9. Once completed, close the terminal.

## Usage

1. Open Terminal in `MRAi_2D-master` folder.
2. Active `mrai` environment with:
```python
conda activate mrai
```
3. Run Jupyter Notebook with:
```python
jupyter notebook
```
4. Open and run one of the Jupyter notebooks (`*.ipynb`), following the instructions provided in the file.

5. If necessary, restart the kernel and then shut down any open Jupyter instances before running a new notebook.

## Uninstallation

If it is needed to uninstall the entire environment, open a terminal in the `base` Conda environment and remove the `mrai` environment with:
```python
conda remove --name mrai --all
```
